<h1 align="center">Introduction-to-Network-Structuring-and-Security</h1>

<p>
In the context of our actual project, we will create and structure a complete network for an imaginary enterprise. For this case, we choose a fake online bank named "Bankurity." Then, we will secure it in the most efficient and practical way possible.

In the context of our actual project, once the theoretical plan is ready, we will replicate it using virtual machines (VMs), simplifying if necessary, before presenting it.

Keep in mind that the goal is not to create a complex or advanced architecture, but rather something simple and clean to help beginners properly grasp the concepts.

In this walkthrough, we will focus on the theoretical aspect. Feel free to take it further with the VMs if you wish. If you do, don't hesitate to share your progress with me ðŸ˜Š
