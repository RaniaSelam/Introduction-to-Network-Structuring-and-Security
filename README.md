<h1 align="center">Introduction-to-Network-Structuring-and-Security</h1>

<p>
For this project, we will be creating and structuring a complete network for a given organization. For this case, we will base ourselves on an online bank named "Bankurity." Then, we will have to secure it in the most efficient and practical we can.

In the context of the actual project, once the theoretical plan is ready, we are supposed to replicate it using virtual machines (VMs), simplifying it before if necessary.

Keep in mind that the goal is not to create a complex or advanced architecture, but rather something simple and clean to help beginners properly grasp the concepts.

Throughout this guide, we will be focusing on the theoretical aspect. Feel free to take it further with the VMs if you wish. If you do, don't hesitate to share your progress with me ðŸ˜Š
